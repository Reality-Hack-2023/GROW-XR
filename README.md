# Inspiration
Patients going through long-term treatment often feel that they are living a repetitive daily life. 
It becomes easy for them to lose sight of an end to the treatment, the pain, and the symptoms. 
The monotonous repetitive structure of taking the same medication, doing the same exercises, and answering the same questions about how they are doing overshadows all the progress they have made, and will keep making. It also introduces fatigue that compounds their illness and hinders progress in healing.

# What it does
GROW XR is a virtual platform that assists patients in long-term care in their treatment and rehabilitation journeys through assistive features around restoration and rehabilitation.

# How we built it
Our prototype is a Mimimum Viable Product (MVP) of the experience for a sample user. Using Snapdragon Spaces SDK, C#/Visual Studio, and Unity Engine, we created a prototype that conveys an end-to-end walkthrough of what typical usage experiences will entail to highlight where XR brings value in this solution. We leveraged and customized many nature-themed assets to implement our underlying theme of a memory palace visually. 

# Challenges we ran into
We had challenges around scoping this concept and converting the core scope to an set of experience features and product functionalities. There was a lot of passion and identified areas of interest/opportunity across our group, so we spent significant time aligning on the precise problem to solve for and then narrowing down to get a detailed user persona in focus that could drive our ideas for functionality and design language/styling throughout the experience. Many of our critical moments of challenge were around repivoting to keep design and development actions aligned as we build out the experience's MVP. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are most proud of: (1) Managing and building a multi-scene project in Unity that has a consistent visual theme across scenes, (2) Implementation of interactability on a platform/hardware device that was new to all of us, (3) Powerful and collaborative concept development as a team of cross-functional creatives on a big and emotional problem space, (4) Prototyped implementation of all the major ways XR tech/effects brings value for the solution.

# What we learned
We learned so many new technical concepts involved with device/environment set-up for the ThinkReality glasses. We also learned a lot about modifying leveraged 3D assets. We collectively learned a lot about narrowing scope 

# What's next for GROW XR: My Memory Palace
Future Directions we outlined include: (1) Design user workflow Mechanism How that info gets populated in the first place based on provider’s outline/prescription.
